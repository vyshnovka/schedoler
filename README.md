# ScheDOler

ScheDOler is an application for scheduling tasks and organizing personal time. Nothing innovative, just everything you need (almost).
   
The application allows user to create and manage two types of plans: events and tasks. Events have a specific time and place, and tasks can be marked as completed. All the plans have three options for displaying: in a specific day, for a week or for a month.

The need for authorization makes it possible to use the application by several users from one device.

By now this is an offline desktop application, but maybe someday it will be possible to use it cross-platform.
